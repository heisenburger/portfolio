  <h2 class="xxl">Endlessly curious.</h2>

  <p class="measure">

  </p>

  <p class="measure">
    In a previous life I dabbled in the world of academia, and came out with a First Class Honours in Physics and Math. I had the priviledge of studying in the beautiful halls of UC Berkeley, and grew enormously as a citizen of the world during my tenure there.
  </p>

  <p class="measure space-bottom">
    Nothing makes me happier than crafting elegant, beautiful solutions to large and complex problems. Little did I know at the time that I'd be applying this to digital products!

  <h2 class="xxl">‚ù§ Communities.</h2>

  <p class="measure">
    In the end, it's people who make our products and people who consume them. I care about our local tech communities because I understand that if we foster good communities, we foster good designers, coders, and leaders.
