  <h2 class="xxl">Endlessly curious.</h2>

  <p class="measure">
    Hi! I'm a product designer with an insatiable thirst for knowledge. I've been making and breaking the web since 1999, and have been fully plugged into the technology Matrix ever since.
  </p>

  <p class="measure">
    In a previous life I dabbled in the world of academia, and came out with a First Class Honours in Physics and Math. I had the priviledge of studying in the beautiful halls of UC Berkeley, and grew enormously as a citizen of the world during my tenure there.
  </p>

  <p class="measure space-bottom">
    Nothing makes me happier than finding elegant, beautiful solutions to large and complex problems. Little did I know at the time that I'd be applying this to digital products! That, and good food, good music and good company is what I live for.
  </p>

  <h2 class="xxl">‚ù§ Communities.</h2>

  <p class="measure">
    In the end, it's people who make our products and people who consume them. If we foster good communities, we foster good designers, coders, and leaders. 
  </p>

  <p class="measure space-bottom">
    Outside of my day job and <a href="http://serena.nz">side projects</a>, I enjoy volunteering as an organiser for <a href="http://railsgirls.com/wellington">Rails Girls Wellington</a>, as well as mentoring and coaching at various hackfests and student outreach events, such as <a href="https://summeroftech.co.nz/">Summer of Tech</a>. I've also just given my <a href="http://2016.cssconf.com.au/">first talk at a tech conference</a>! It was super exciting, and I learned so much from the wonderful people there.

  <h2 class="xxl">Forever a nerd.</h2>

  <p class="measure">
    When I'm stressed I like to go through elegant mathematical proofs &mdash; I find the certainty and beauty of it calms me down like nothing else. It's also a good perspective shifter. My problems don't seem so bad when I've gone through a proof that took humanity hundreds of years to solve.
  </p>

  <p class="measure">
    Other nerdy things I like to indulge in include security, reverse-engineering puzzles, Magic the Gathering (though not much anymore, because $$$), architecture, video games (my list is neverending), and Star Trek: Voyager.
  </p>

  <p class="measure space-bottom">
    Don't get it twisted though. While I feel that &#8220;science nerd&#8221; describes me well, it can't quite contain my love for art, fashion, music, history and poetry.
