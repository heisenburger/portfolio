  <h2 class="xxl">Challenging the media landscape.</h2>

  <p class="measure">
    <a href="http://hvngrymag.com">HVNGRY</a> is an online publication for teen girls (and boys) wanting more from mainstream media. It’s a belly full of inspiration, motivation, passion, power, and taking-over-the-world.
  </p>

  <p class="measure">
    This was a passion project that stemmed from a frustration with the lack of high-quality media for teens (especially teen girls), as well as the drive to change a negative media landscape for the better.

  <h2 class="xxl space-top">From dreams to reality</h2>

  <p class="measure">
    One day I found myself waiting in a men’s clothing shop. Picking up a men’s magazine, I flipped through. In seconds I saw the reality behind hours of discussions about gender, power and prominence. In place of diets were how-tos in self-motivation. The gossip section was replaced by negotiation strategies for higher salaries. It was clear that gender equality, like repeats of Friends, was a modern fairy tale we point to as a comforting fantasy.
  </p>
  <p class="measure">I think young women are sick of it. I think we're hungry for more.

  <blockquote class="xl f-i">
    First, we needed validation. So I crafted an anonymous survey, and sent it out to the world. 
  </blockquote>

  <p class="measure">
    The response was everything from hilarious to inspirational to heartbreaking.
  </p>

  <p class="measure">
    “Stop eating or you’ll get fat”, answers a nameless 13-year-old when asked what she would tell her past self. “I would tell myself not to be afraid to put myself out there,” remarks a 14-year-old from New Plymouth. When asked to describe themselves, another 13-year-old spat out: “Ugly and funny and cool and fat”.
  </p>

  <p class="measure">
    They are not without dreams. Another 13-year-old looks to go to medical school to become a lab technician. Another 14-year-old aspires to study fashion at Parson’s New School of Design in New York City. Why do we underestimate them so? So often are teens girls reduced to the image of brainless, rampant fans screaming about the next Twilight movie — they deserve a space where their voices are respected, their worries addressed and their aspirations fuelled.
