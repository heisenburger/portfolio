  <h2 class="xxl">Challenging the media landscape.</h2>

  <p class="measure">
    <a href="http://hvngrymag.com">HVNGRY</a> is an online publication for teen girls (and boys) wanting more from mainstream media. It’s a belly full of inspiration, motivation, passion, power, and taking-over-the-world.
  </p>

  <p class="measure">
    This was a passion project that stemmed from a frustration with the lack of high-quality media for teens (especially teen girls), as well as the drive to change a negative media landscape for the better.

  <h2 class="xxl space-top">From dreams to reality</h2>

  <p class="measure">
    One day I found myself flipping through a mens magazine. It's one thing to talk about gender equality, and another to experience it so bluntly. In place of diets were how-tos in self-motivation. The gossip section was replaced by negotiation strategies for higher salaries. It was clear that gender equality, like repeats of Friends, was a modern fairy tale we point to as a comforting fantasy.
  </p>
  <p class="measure">I think young women are sick of it. I think we're hungry for more.

    First, we needed validation. So I crafted an anonymous survey, and sent it out to the world. 
  </blockquote>

  <p class="measure">
    The response was everything from hilarious to inspirational to heartbreaking.
  </p>

  <p class="measure">
    “Stop eating or you’ll get fat”, answers a nameless 13-year-old when asked what she would tell her past self. A 14-year-old: “I would tell myself not to be afraid to put myself out there”. When asked to describe themselves, another 13-year-old spat out: “Ugly and funny and cool and fat”.
  </p>

  <p class="measure">
    They are not without dreams. Another 13-year-old looks to go to medical school to become a lab technician. Another 14-year-old aspires to study fashion at Parson’s New School of Design in New York City.

  <p class="measure">
    So often are teens girls reduced to the image of brainless, rampant fans screaming about the next Twilight movie — they deserve a space where their voices are respected, their worries addressed and their aspirations fuelled.

  <h2 class="xxl space-top">Getting personal</h2>

  <p class="measure">
    Because our ethos was about inclusivity and embracing all the different sides to being a teen, we needed a brand that was both ultra flexible and clearly cohesive. We also wanted to make it clear that it was a teen girl magazine, without not-teens or not-girlst feeling weird about reading it. The design therefore required a balance between traditionally feminine touches, without being overly gendered.

  <p class="measure">
    The elegant headings in classic Georgia gave us that touch of femininity, while a big, bold logo gave us the punch that we needed.

  <p class="measure">
    Filling the logo space with patterns, rather than solid colours, gave us infinite flexibility and a way to set the stage of the current theme.

  <h2 class="xxl space-top">Content first design.</h2>

  <p class="measure">
    <strong>A tale of two modes:</strong> Readers usually happen upon our site in one of two ways. Either they've followed a link to a specific article, or they've landed on the home page and want to get a taste for what HVNGRY is about, fast. Either they're in reading mode, or discovery mode.
  </p>

  <p class="measure">
    Much like how most of the time we're hitting next on shuffle rather than knowing exactly &mdash; or even vaguely &mdash; what we want, I opted for a non-sorted front page that featured the headlines equally large, cascading chronicologically down the page. Simple tags would inform the genre and general topic of the piece, but otherwise, the reader was free to inundate herself in a river of variety, and click into whatever felt peaked her interest at the time.
